Javier Andreu-Perez (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in 2012. He is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor, tenured) in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) and a member of the Centre for Computational Intelligence at the University of Essex, United Kingdom. He was awarded his PhD in Intelligent Systems from Lancaster University (UK) and MSc from the University of Granada (Spain). 

His expertise focuses on artificial intelligence, and fuzzy methodologies & computing-with-words approach for uncertainty modelling in highly noisy, non-stationary, high-dimensional data. Javier has published in journals edited by Elsevier, Springer-Nature, IEEE (TFS, TSMC, TBMI, JBHI, TDCS, etc.), and other venues in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience. Javier's work in artificial intelligence, human informatics and biomedical engineering has attracted 4000+ citations. Javier was chair of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) task force on Extensions of Type-1 fuzzy sets (2018-2022). Javier acts as associate Editor-in-chief of the journal Neurocomputing (Elsevier), the EUSFLAT-sponsored International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, and other newer journals on emerging technologies. He’s been invited as an expert reviewer for significant publishers such as Science, The Lancet, and BMC. He has served on the technical committee for IEEE WCCI several times and as the workshop chair for FUZZ-IEEE. He has regularly led tutorials and a special session at this event. He was also the general chair for fNIRS-UK 2023. Javier's research has been founded by UK research councils, other funding schemes supported by the Welcome Trust, NIHR, and big-IT corporations such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Oracle. Javier has an extensive portfolio of completed successful knowledge transfer and collaboration with the industry. Dr Andreu-Perez has been awarded prestigious fellowships for his research career from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (2022) and a Talentia Senior Fellowship from the Andalusia Scientific Council (2020). His research interests focus on human informatics, symbiotic artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, robotics, sensor engineering, bio/neuro-engineering, and life science research.
